Introduction
------------
In this project, two machine learning models were developed to accurately classify objects into three distinct categories: bars, gold coins, and mangal sutra. This project aims to showcase skills in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using both SVM and YOLO.

Dataset
-------
The dataset used for this project contains images of bars, gold coins, and mangal sutra. The data was split into training and validation sets to ensure a robust evaluation of the models' performance.

SVM Model
---------
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is a powerful classification algorithm particularly suited for binary classification tasks but can be extended to multi-class problems using techniques such as one-vs-one or one-vs-all. The model was trained using features extracted from the images.

Training
--------
The SVM model was trained using the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Images were resized and normalized.
2. Feature Extraction: Features were extracted from images using techniques such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) or others.
3. Model Training: The SVM classifier was trained on the extracted features.

YOLO Model
----------
The YOLO (You Only Look Once) model is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. It processes images in real-time and can identify multiple objects in a single pass.

Training
--------
The YOLO model was trained using the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Images were resized and augmented to improve generalization.
2. Model Training: The YOLO model was trained using a combination of convolutional and fully connected layers specifically designed for object detection tasks.

Evaluation
----------
The models' performance was evaluated using the validation dataset. The primary metric used for evaluation was accuracy. Additionally, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated to provide a comprehensive assessment of the models' performance.
